<h1>PART B -- ALLOCATION</h1>

<h2>2. Allocation of Group Liability</h2>

<h3>2.1 Consideration</h3>
<p>In consideration for the mutual promises set out in this Agreement, each Group Member agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>2.2 Purpose of Allocation Provisions</h3>
<p>The purpose of the allocation provisions of this Agreement, as contained in this Part B (and supplemented by the other provisions of this Agreement), is to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>reasonably allocate each Group Liability among the Group Members;</li>
<li>provide certainty in relation to such allocation so that a Group Member's Contribution Amount may be determined primarily by reference to this Part B; and</li>
<li>meet any and all requirements for a valid Tax Sharing Agreement.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2.3 Reasonable Allocation</h3>
<p>The amount of the Group Liability allocated to each Group Member under this Agreement represents a reasonable allocation of the total amount of the Group Liability among the Group Members immediately prior to the Due Date for that Group Liability.</p>

<h3>2.4 Allocation of Group Liabilities</h3>
<p>Subject to clause 2.5, each Group Liability with an original assessment with a Due Date after the date of this Agreement must be allocated either to, or among, the Head Company and each of the Contributing Members who were parties to this Agreement immediately prior to the Due Date of the original assessment of such Group Liability in accordance with the relevant Allocation Principles.</p>

<h3>2.5 Pre-Consolidation Liabilities</h3>
<p>Any liabilities of a Group Member to the Commissioner that relate to the period prior to that party becoming a Member of the Consolidated Group remain the liability of that Group Member.</p>

<h3>2.6 Payment to Commissioner</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, if the Head Company does not pay or otherwise discharge in full a Group Liability by the Due Date, each Contributing Member will only be liable to pay the Commissioner an amount equal to the Contribution Amount of that Contributing Member for that Group Liability, and such amount will be due and payable to the Commissioner, in the circumstances set out in section 721-30(5) or (5A) of ITAA 1997, as the case may be.</p>

<h3>2.7 No Debt</h3>
<p>No Group Member may claim a debt is due from another Group Member in relation to any Contribution Amount payable by a Contributing Member to the Commissioner.</p>

<h3>2.8 No Reduction for Funding Amount</h3>
<p>The amount payable by a Contributing Member in accordance with clause 2.6 will not be reduced, increased or otherwise affected by any amount paid, payable, received or receivable by a Contributing Member under the terms of a Tax Funding Agreement or any other tax funding or contribution agreement between one or more of the Group Members.</p>

<h2>3. Calculation and Recording of Contribution Amounts</h2>

<h3>3.1 Calculation Advice</h3>
<p>Immediately upon the earlier of the Head Company becoming aware of a possible default, or actual default, in the payment of part or all of a Group Liability by the relevant Due Date, the Head Company must calculate the Contribution Amount of each Group Member in respect of that Group Liability and advise each Group Member in writing of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the amount of its Contribution Amount;</li>
<li>the method of calculation of the amount in paragraph (a) above; and</li>
<li>any other information it considers reasonable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Contribution Amount of each Group Member as calculated by the Head Company under this clause 3.1 is binding on each Group Member except in the case of manifest error.</p>

<h3>3.2 Assistance by Contributing Members</h3>
<p>Each Contributing Member must provide the Head Company with any information it may reasonably require in relation to a Group Liability.</p>

<h3>3.3 Retention of Records</h3>
<p>Each Group Member must retain a record of each Calculation Advice (provided to, or by, it, as the case may be) for a period of not less than seven years from the date of its making.</p>

<h3>3.4 Provision of Calculation Advices</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributing Member is only entitled to be given Calculation Advices that relate to that particular Contributing Member and not any Calculation Advices that relate to any other Group Member.</p>

<h3>3.5 Annexures</h3>
<p>The Head Company must attach as Annexure "A" to its counterpart of this Agreement any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Calculation Advice issued by it to a Group Member under clause 3.1;</li>
<li>Accession Agreement entered into by it with a new Group Member;</li>
<li>Release Agreement entered into by it with an Exiting Member; and</li>
<li>other document it considers relevant to the interpretation of this Agreement.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Clear Exit From Group Liability</h2>

<h3>4.1 Exit from the Consolidated Group</h3>
<p>This clause 4 applies if a Group Member will cease to be a Member of the Consolidated Group (<strong>Exiting Member</strong>).</p>

<h3>4.2 Provision of information to Exiting Member</h3>
<p>Prior to the date the Exiting Member ceases to be a Member of the Consolidated Group (<strong>Exit Date</strong>), the Head Company must provide the Exiting Member with a calculation (which for the avoidance of doubt may be nil) of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>if a Contribution Amount can be determined for the Exiting Member pursuant to clause 2 for a Group Liability of the Head Company with a Due Date after the Exit Date, that Contribution Amount;</li>
<li>if a Contribution Amount cannot be determined for the Exiting Member pursuant to clause 2 for a Group Liability of the Head Company with a Due Date after the Exit Date, a reasonable estimate of that Contribution Amount;</li>
<li>if, before the Exit Date, the Head Company anticipates that after the Exit Date there will be an Amended Assessment in respect of a Tax-Related Liability, which relates to a Tax-Related Period during which the Exiting Member was a Member of the Consolidated Group, an amount that is a reasonable estimate of the Contribution Amount of the Exiting Member that takes into account the anticipated Amended Assessment; and</li>
<li>such other amount that Division 721 of ITAA 1997 may specify from time to time that will allow the Exiting Member to leave the Consolidated Group clear of a Group Liability.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.3 Conclusive Evidence</h3>
<p>The calculation by the Head Company of any Contribution Amount due under clause 4.2 is conclusive evidence of that Contribution Amount of the Exiting Member in respect to a Group Liability.</p>

<h3>4.4 Payment of Contribution Amount by Exiting Member</h3>
<p>Before the Exit Date, the Exiting Member must pay the Head Company the Contribution Amounts, if any, calculated under clause 4.2, at which time the Head Company must acknowledge receipt of such payment in writing and hold such payment separate from the other funds of the Head Company until the Due Date for each relevant Group Liability at which time the payment may be used to meet the relevant Tax-Related Liability.</p>

<h3>4.5 Nil Contribution Amount</h3>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if a Contribution Amount calculated pursuant to clause 4.2 is nil, the Exiting Member will be deemed to have made the relevant payment under clause 4.4.</p>

<h3>4.6 Release</h3>
<p>The Head Company and the Exiting Member must execute a Release Agreement: (a) provided that the Exiting Member has made; or (b) that is effective conditional upon the Exiting Member making, all payments required under clause 4.4.

<h2>8. Changes to the Law</h2>

<p>If a change occurs (including, but not limited to for the purpose of this clause 8, a change that occurs because a regulation is made for the purposes of section 721-25(1)(d) of ITAA 1997) to a law or policy of the Commissioner that applies to this Agreement in a manner that: (a) affects the legal or practical effect that, but for that change, this Agreement would have had; or (b) results in this Agreement not covering all Group Liabilities for the purposes of section 721-25 of ITAA 1997, then as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the change, the Contributing Members must act in good faith with the Head Company to determine and make such changes (if any) to this Agreement as may be necessary to restore the legal or practical effect referred to in paragraph (a) or to ensure that this Agreement does not have the result referred to in paragraph (b).</p>

<h3>8.2 Deemed Amendment</h3>
<p>Despite clause 8.1, if a change to a law or policy of the Commissioner occurs that applies to this Agreement in a manner that results in this Agreement not covering all Group Liabilities for the purposes of section 721-25 of ITAA 1997, this Agreement is deemed to be amended from the date such law came into effect, so that the relevant Group Liability not covered will be covered and allocated among the Group Members on the same basis as if it were an Item 3 Tax-Related Liability.</p>

<h2>9. Precedence of Regulations</h2>

<p>This Agreement is deemed to be varied in accordance with the decision of the Dispute Expert effective from the date specified in the decision. The Group Members must share the costs of the Dispute Expert equally, unless prior agreement can be reached between the parties.</p>

<h3>9.4 Deemed Incorporation of rules and regulations</h3>
<p>Subject to clause 9.4(b), if the Commissioner or the Treasury issues any ruling or makes any regulation: (i) stipulating any matter which must or must not be included in a TSA; or (ii) which states what will be acceptable as a means of calculating a liability to income tax; or (iii) which in any other way regulates what a TSA must contain or must not contain, then this Agreement is deemed to incorporate any such ruling or regulation to the extent necessary to preserve or achieve validity of this Agreement as a TSA under Division 721 of ITAA 1997 and any policy of the Commissioner from the date of effect of such ruling or regulation, and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with such ruling or regulation, the provisions of the ruling or regulation will prevail.</p>
<p>If the ruling or regulation prescribes alternatives for preserving or achieving such validity, this Agreement is deemed to incorporate the alternative most consistent with the pre-existing terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>This Agreement: (a) applies to each Group Liability with an original Due Date after the date of this Agreement; and (b) despite anything in this Agreement, does not apply to any Group Liability in relation to which the Prior TSA applies.</p>` : ''}

<h2>11. Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>11.1 Amendment</h3>
<p>The Group Members (other than any Exiting Member released pursuant to clause 4.6 or a Group Member that has been liquidated, deregistered, wound up or dissolved) may at any time amend, vary or replace this Agreement by written agreement, but not so as to adversely affect the obligations or rights of any Exiting Member released pursuant to clause 4.6.</p>
<p>An amendment, variation or replacement of this Agreement by written agreement under clause 11.1(a) is deemed to have been made between all Group Members if no Group Member has objected in writing to the proposed amendment or variation within seven days of receipt of a notice from the Head Company setting out the proposed amendment or variation.</p>

<h3>11.2 GST</h3>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong> In this clause 11.2, the expressions "adjustment note", "consideration", "GST", "supply", "tax invoice", "supplier", "recipient", and "taxable supply" have the meaning given to those expressions in the GST Act. For the avoidance of doubt, "GST" excludes any penalties or additional tax imposed in relation to the GST.</p>
<p><strong>Sums exclude GST:</strong> Unless otherwise expressly stated, the consideration to be provided or payment obligation under this Agreement is exclusive of GST.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility for GST:</strong> Despite any other provision in this Agreement, if GST is imposed on any supply made under this Agreement, the recipient must pay to the supplier any amount equal to the GST payable on the supply. The recipient must pay the amount in addition to and at the same time as payment for the supply is required to be made under this Agreement. The supplier must pay any GST penalties, interest or additional tax imposed on the supplier and attributable to its act or omission.</p>
<p><strong>Tax invoice:</strong> If a supply is made to which GST applies or is varied under this Agreement, the supplier must provide to the recipient of the supply a valid tax invoice or adjustment note at or before the time of payment or variation.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> If the amount of GST paid or payable by the supplier on any supply made under this Agreement differs from the amount of GST paid by the recipient, because the Commissioner lawfully adjusts the value of the taxable supply for the purpose of calculating GST, then the amount of GST paid by the recipient must be adjusted accordingly by a further payment by the recipient to the supplier or the supplier to the recipient, as the case requires.</p>

<h3>Tax-Related Liability: Item 5 subsection 721-10(2) of ITAA 1997 -- section 197-70 of ITAA 1997 (untainting tax)</h3>
<p><strong>Allocation Principles:</strong> The Group Member which made the election under section 197-55 of ITAA 1997 must pay the whole of this Tax-Related Liability.</p>

<h3>Tax-Related Liability: Items 10, 15, 20, 22 subsection 721-10(2) of ITAA 1997 (franking tax)</h3>

<h3>Tax-Related Liability: Item 3 subsection 721-10(2) of ITAA 1997 -- section 5-5 of ITAA 1997 (income tax)</h3>
<p><strong>Allocation Principles:</strong> The Contribution Amount for each Group Member in respect to the Item 3 Tax-Related Liability will be determined based on a Notional ${data.allocationBasis === 'taxation' ? 'Taxation' : 'Accounting'} Basis as set out below:</p>

${data.allocationBasis === 'taxation' ? `
<h4>Notional Taxation Basis</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>An amount reflecting the notional income, or loss, as the case may be, for taxation for each Member of the Consolidated Group for the relevant year of income will be determined assuming that each was a stand alone entity and not a Member of the Consolidated Group.</li>
<li>The notional income, or loss, of a Member who was not a party to this Agreement prior to the Due Date of the original assessment of the Tax-Related Liability will be added to the notional income, or loss, of the Head Company as part of the calculation under (a) above.</li>
<li>If the determination in (a) and (b) above results in a Group Member having a notional loss then: (i) such loss will be notionally transferred to each Group Member with a notional income pro-rata in proportion to the amount by which such Group Member's notional income bears to the notional income of all Group Members whose notional income is greater than zero; and (ii) that Group Member's notional taxation liability will be zero.</li>
<li>The notional taxation liability of a Member will be determined by multiplying the notional income of that Member by the tax rate applicable to the Consolidated Group.</li>
<li>The Tax-Related Liability will be allocated among each Group Member in proportion to the amount which that Group Member's notional taxation liability bears to the aggregate notional taxation liability of all Group Members.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Gross Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>The Gross Income Tax Contribution Amount of each Group Member will then be reduced by: (i) any Contribution Amounts for Items 30, 32 and 35 Tax-Related Liabilities allocated to it in respect of that year of income; and (ii) any other amounts paid or payable by that Group Member for which the Head Company has, does or will receive a credit under section 45â€‘30 in Schedule 1 to TAA 1953 for that income year; or a credit under section 45â€‘865 in Schedule 1 to TAA 1953 for that income year.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Net Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>If any Group Member's Net Income Tax Contribution Amount is less than or equal to zero: (i) such Net Income Tax Contribution Amount will be notionally transferred to each Group Member with a Net Income Tax Contribution Amount of greater than zero, pro rata in proportion to the amount by which such Group Member's Net Income Tax Contribution Amount bears to the Net Income Tax Contribution Amounts of all Group Members whose Net Income Tax Contribution Amounts are greater than zero; and (ii) that Group Member's Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount will be zero.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>The Tax-Related Liability will then be reduced by the amount of: (i) any credit under section 45-30 in Schedule 1 of TAA 1953 for that income year; and (ii) any credit under section 45-865 in Schedule 1 of TAA 1953 for that income year, (the <strong>721-25(1A) Adjusted Tax Related Liability</strong>).</li>
<li>The 721-25(1A) Adjusted Tax Related Liability will be allocated between each Group Member in proportion to the amount which that Group Member's Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount bears to the aggregate Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amounts of all Group Members.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Contribution Amount.</li>
</ol>
` : `
<h4>Notional Accounting Basis</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>The notional profit or loss before tax of each Member of the Consolidated Group will be determined based on the accounts of each such Member in the relevant year of income.</li>
<li>An adjustment will be made to the amount calculated at paragraph (a) to: (i) eliminate any transactions between Members; and (ii) exclude, where the Member is a Trust or Partnership, any amounts that would be included in determining the profit before tax of another Member as a stand alone entity by virtue of that Member being a beneficiary of the Trust or a partner in the Partnership, as the case may be.</li>
<li>Any income or expenses that are referrable to part of the relevant year of income in which the Member was not part of the Consolidated Group which will be apportioned on a reasonable basis to the period during which the Member was not a Member of the Consolidated Group.</li>
<li>The notional profit or loss before tax of a Member who was not a party to this Agreement prior to the Due Date of the original assessment of the Tax-Related Liability will be added to notional profit or loss before tax of the Head Company.</li>
<li>If after applying the above paragraphs a Group Member has a notional loss then: (i) such loss will be notionally transferred to each Group Member with a notional profit pro-rata in proportion to the amount by which such Group Member's notional profit bears to the notional profits of all Group Members whose notional profit is greater than zero; and (ii) that Group Member's profit or loss before tax will be zero.</li>
<li>The Tax Related Liability will be allocated among each Group Member based on the proportion that the notional profit or loss before tax of each Group Member bears to the sum of the notional profit or loss before tax for all Group Members.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Gross Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>The Gross Income Tax Contribution Amount of each Group Member will then be reduced by: (i) any Contribution Amounts for Items 30, 32 and 35 Tax Related Liabilities allocated to it in respect of that year of income; (ii) any other amounts paid or payable by that Group Member for which the Head Company has, does or will receive a credit under section 45â€‘30 in Schedule 1 to TAA 1953 for that income year; or a credit under section 45â€‘865 in Schedule 1 to TAA 1953 for that income year.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Net Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>If any Group Member's Net Income Tax Contribution Amount is less than or equal to zero: (i) such Net Income Tax Contribution Amount will be notionally transferred to each Group Member with a Net Income Tax Contribution Amount of greater than zero, pro rata in proportion to the amount by which such Group Member's Net Income Tax Contribution Amount bears to the Net Income Tax Contribution Amounts of all Group Members whose Net Income Tax Contribution Amounts are greater than zero; and (ii) that Group Member's Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount will be zero.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount.</li>
<li>The Tax-Related Liability will then be reduced by the amount of: (i) any credit under section 45-30 in Schedule 1 of TAA 1953 for that income year; and (ii) any credit under section 45-865 in Schedule 1 of TAA 1953 for that income year, (the <strong>721-25(1A) Adjusted Tax-Related Liability</strong>).</li>
<li>The 721-25(1A) Adjusted Tax-Related Liability will be allocated between each Group Member in proportion to the amount which that Group Member's Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amount bears to the aggregate Net Adjusted Income Tax Contribution Amounts of all Group Members.</li>
<li>The amount so allocated to each Group Member is its Contribution Amount.</li>
